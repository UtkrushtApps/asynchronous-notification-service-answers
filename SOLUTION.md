# Solution Steps

1. Create a new Spring Boot application and enable @EnableAsync for async processing.

2. Configure a dedicated thread pool Executor bean (notificationExecutor) in an AsyncConfig class with proper pool size and settings.

3. Define a NotificationRequest POJO that contains the fields for email, phone number, push token, and message.

4. Create a NotificationService interface with a method void sendAsyncNotification(NotificationRequest request).

5. Implement NotificationServiceImpl, injecting the notificationExecutor. In sendAsyncNotification, use CompletableFuture.runAsync for each notification channel (email, SMS, push) using the configured executor.

6. For each notification send, add a whenComplete callback to log the success or failure asynchronously.

7. Handle exceptions in each async task so that errors are logged and do not affect the API's immediate response.

8. In the controller, inject NotificationService, expose a /notifications POST endpoint, and call sendAsyncNotification with the incoming request.

9. Ensure that ResponseEntity is returned immediately without waiting for notification completion.

10. In each dummy notification method (sendEmail, sendSms, sendPushNotification), simulate latency and exception scenarios for demonstration.

11. Test the API by posting to /notifications and observe immediate API response and the delayed, logged, async notification results.
